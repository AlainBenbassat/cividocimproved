# Managing Events

CiviEvent is the part of CiviCRM that helps you manage events. It supports everything from small training sessions and volunteer briefings to large fundraising dinners and community gatherings.

With CiviEvent, you can:

* Set up and promote events

* Let people register online

* Track attendance

* Send reminders and thank-you emails

* Collect payments if needed

It’s designed to save your team time while offering a smooth experience for your attendees.

## Who is CiviEvent for?

CiviEvent is especially useful for non-profits, community groups, and membership organisations. If your work involves organising in-person or online events — like workshops, open days, webinars, or conferences — then CiviEvent can help.

It’s flexible enough to support simple or complex event types, including free or paid options, public or invitation-only events, and single or recurring sessions.

## What can you do with CiviEvent?

Here are some of the key things you can do with CiviEvent:

* **Create an event**: Add details like title, date, location, and description.

* **Enable online registration**: Let participants sign up online using a form.

* **Collect information**: Choose what details you want to gather, like names, contact info, and dietary needs.

* **Take payments**: Set up pricing and accept payments using a secure system (if your event isn’t free).

* **Send emails**: Confirm registrations, remind attendees, and follow up afterwards.

* **Track attendance**: Mark who actually showed up and download reports if needed.

## Why use CiviEvent?

Managing events manually can take up a lot of time and leave room for mistakes. Using CiviEvent lets you:

* Keep all event information in one place

* Avoid duplicate contacts

* Make registration easier for attendees

* Quickly see how your events are going

* Improve communication with participants

It also works with other parts of CiviCRM, like contacts, memberships, and contributions — so you get a full picture of your supporters and their engagement.
