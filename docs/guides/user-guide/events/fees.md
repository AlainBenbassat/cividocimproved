# Setting Up Fees and Online Registration

Once you’ve created a basic event, you can configure payments and registration options. This guide walks through setting up fee structures, payment processors, and the online registration experience.

## Step 1: Enable Event Fees

If your event requires payment:

* **Mark the Event as Paid:**  
  Enable this option to begin entering pricing details.

* **Select a Financial Type:**  
  Choose the appropriate accounting category (e.g., Event Fee, Membership Dues). This determines how income is tracked in your financial reports.

* **Choose a Payment Processor:**  
  Pick one of your enabled processors for handling credit/debit card payments. Make sure the processor is already configured in your system settings.

* **Allow Pay Later (Optional):**  
  Let attendees register without paying immediately. You'll need to provide clear instructions (e.g., “Bring cash to the event,” or “Invoice will be sent later”).

## Step 2: Set Pricing Options

You have two main ways to define prices:

### **Option A: Standard Fees**

Set fixed prices for each participant type.

* Add different price levels (e.g., General Admission, Student, VIP).

* Choose whether prices are visible or hidden.

* Assign each fee a financial type.

### **Option B: Use Price Sets (Advanced)**

If you need more flexibility (e.g., multiple add-ons, donations, or variable quantities), use a **Price Set**.

* Create a price set under **Administer \> CiviEvent \> Price Sets**.

* Include options like t-shirt purchases or meal selections.

* Attach the price set to the event’s fee settings.

## Step 3: Enable Online Registration

To let attendees sign up through your website:

* **Allow Online Registration:**  
  Toggle this on to enable the registration form.

* **Customize the Registration Link Text:**  
  This appears as the call-to-action (e.g., “Sign Up Now” or “Book My Place”).

* **Set Registration Open/Close Dates:**  
  Control when registration becomes available and when it ends.

* **Enable Confirmation Screen (Optional):**  
  After submission, attendees can review a confirmation before finalizing registration.

* **Multiple Participants:**  
  Let a single person register multiple attendees in one go. This is useful for family events or corporate trainings. You can define how many people can be added per registration.

## Best Practices

* **Keep Fee Structures Simple:**  
  Unless you need custom price sets, stick to 2–4 tiers for clarity.

* **Test Registration:**  
  Always preview and test the registration form before publishing. Use both paid and unpaid scenarios.

* **Accessibility and Clarity:**  
  Avoid jargon in fee labels. Be specific (e.g., “Early Bird – Ends March 31”).
