# Creating an Event

Planning events is a key part of many nonprofit operations. Whether you're organizing a small training or a large conference, a well-configured event setup will help streamline registrations, manage participants, and track finances. This guide walks you through each step of creating an event in your CRM, from basic details to advanced features.

## Step 1: Start a New Event

To begin, go to the main menu and choose **Events \> New Event**.

If you don’t see the Events option, make sure it’s enabled under your system settings.

## Step 2: Fill in Basic Details

On the event creation screen, start by entering general information:

* **Template (optional):** Use a saved event template to pre-fill common settings.

* **Event Type:** Choose the category that best describes your event (e.g., workshop, fundraiser).

* **Campaign:** Link the event to an existing campaign if relevant.

* **Participant Role:** Set default roles for attendees (e.g., Volunteer, Speaker).

* **Public Listing:** Decide if the event should appear in public listings.

* **Title:** Choose a clear, specific name for the event.

* **Summary & Description:** Provide both a short overview and a full description.

* **Dates and Times:** Set the event’s start and end.

* **Maximum Participants:** If needed, enter a limit for how many people can attend.

* **Map Display:** Enable a map if you'd like to show the event location visually.

* **Social Sharing:** Allow attendees to share the event on social media.

* **Status:** Set the event as Active or Inactive.

* **Calendar Invite:** Choose whether to offer a downloadable calendar file.

Once complete, click **Continue** to move on.

## Step 3: Add Location Details

On the location tab, enter:

* **Venue Address:** You can select a saved location or enter a new one.

* **Contact Info:** Include an email and phone number for event inquiries.
