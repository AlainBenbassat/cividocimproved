# Automating Event Communications

Automated messages help you stay connected with attendees before, during, and after your event. This guide covers how to set up reminders, confirmation emails, receipts, and optional referral features.

## Step 1: Scheduled Reminders

Use scheduled reminders to automatically send emails based on timing and contact activity. These are helpful for:

* Event reminders (e.g., “See you tomorrow\!”)

* Follow-up messages (e.g., “Thanks for attending\!”)

* Task-based prompts (e.g., “Complete your registration”)

### To configure reminders

1. Go to your event’s **Scheduled Reminders** tab.

2. Click **Add Reminder**.

3. Choose the **Trigger Date** (e.g., before or after the event start date).

4. Select **Recipient Type** (e.g., all registered participants, attendees, or those with a specific role).

5. Write your message or choose a template.

6. Set the subject, sender address, and reply-to email.

7. Save the reminder.

**Tip:** Use reminders sparingly. One or two key messages are often more effective than a flood of emails.
    
## Step 2: Tell-a-Friend (Optional)

This optional feature lets attendees promote your event to others via email.

### To enable

1. Go to the **Tell-a-Friend** tab.

2. Check **Enable Tell-a-Friend for this event**.

3. Customize the message title and body.

4. Set the number of friends a participant can notify.

This feature is simple to use and helps boost reach without extra effort.

## Step 3: Confirmation and Receipt Emails

After someone registers, it’s good practice to send them two messages:

1. **Confirmation Email**  
   Sent immediately after registration. You can:

    * Customize the message to include event details, directions, or FAQs.

    * Include a calendar file so attendees can save the event easily.

    * Add contact info in case they have questions.

2. **Receipt (if paid)**  
   Sent alongside the confirmation, this includes payment details. You can:

    * Edit the message and subject line.

    * Include a payment summary and balance (if any).

    * Add organizational branding and footer.

### Configuration Tips:

* Go to the **Online Registration** tab and scroll down to the **Confirmation and Receipt** sections.

* Always test messages before launch.

* Keep language warm, clear, and action-oriented.

## Final Checks

Before your event goes live:

* Preview and test every automated email.

* Check from-addresses to make sure they’re monitored inboxes.

* Walk through the entire registration flow as a test user (paid and free).
